# chirper

Chirper is a micro-blogging app in which users can browse a feed of "chirps" and post their own. This was built for a recent React Native workshop. This uses React Native, TypeScript and Apollo GraphQL. We're using [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/) for the UI components. There is a simple GraphQL backend which can be found [here](https://github.com/sstur/chirper-api).

# Getting Started

Make sure you have Node v14 or newer installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sstur/chirper.git
cd chirper
cp .env.example .env
# Update your .env to point to the correct backend
npm install
npm start
```
